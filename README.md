# SIMD,OMP, and MPI
- SIMD: Single instruction, multiple data. SIMD is a class of parrallel computers in which a single operation is performed on multiple data points simultaneously. These operations happen in parallel to eachother. However, only one process can be performed at once. Multiple data points cannot have different operations being performed on them concurrently. 
- OMP: OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing). OMP is an API that has support for shared memory multiprocessing programming in languages such as C. OpenMP and MPI can both be used to run applications that utilize parallel programming on a computer cluster. Including "#include <omp.h>" in a C file will allow multithreading within C functions.
- MPI: Message passing interface. MPI is a message-passing standard designed to work in conjunction with parallel computing. It acts as means of communication to make parallel computing efficient. It focuses on high performance and is readily available with free implementations. Including "#include <mpi.h>" is necessary for all MPI programs in C.
